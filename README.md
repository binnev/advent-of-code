# Advent of Code

My Advent of Code solutions in multiple languages. Open each language folder as a project in your IDE of choice. E.g. open the `python/` folder in Pycharm. 

`_inputs` contains the puzzle inputs for my account. `_solutions` contains the corresponding solutions (these can be used by tests when implementing an existing puzzle in a new language).
